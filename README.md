### Database Design

### Project Management
For this project, we utilized a Kanban Board to stay organized and manage our daily tasks as developers. We created a list of "todos" and organized them into multiple columns. Because of this, we were easily able to assign ownership and track progress through various phases of development. Our go-to project planning resource was Trello.
